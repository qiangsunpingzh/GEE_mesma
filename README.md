# The pixels recorded in satellite images often contain more than one ground units, this leads to inaccuracies in the monitoring of surface structure, state and function. Recent advances in spectral mixture analysis (SMA) methods have facilitated investigation of estimating fractional endmember abundances in the mixed pixels. This method assumes that the reflectance of target mixing pixel is a linear combination of the weighting coefficients (proportional endmembers) and associated pure spectra.

# The Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) has been used for to estimate fractional vegetation-soil continues nexuses based on selected endmember spectra. The fully constrained least squares SMA model is selected to estimate fractions and count RMSE for each endmember combination in GEE platform. We finally search a specific endmember combination with the smallest RMSE, and achieve the estimated endmember fractions of this combination as final fractions. In addition, for endmembers that are not included the achieved combination, we set the fraction values of these endmembers as 0.
